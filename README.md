## How to run
* Run `npm install` before trying to run live react server just to check (update, install) dependencies.
* `npm run` will run the react (frontend) server.
* `yarn start-api` will run the backend server (see more in `package.json`).

**If you are having troubles to run the live server** with `npm run` and getting errors, try delete the `node_modules` folder (`sudo rm -r node_modules`) and run `npm install` again.
